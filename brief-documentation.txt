We've integrated Entity Framework Core to manage our SQLite database effectively. Here are the packages you need to install to get up to speed:

Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore - Core library for using EF Core.
bash
Copy
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite - Allows EF Core to work with SQLite.
bash
Copy
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Sqlite
Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design - Required for design-time functionalities such as migrations.
bash
Copy
dotnet add package Microsoft.EntityFrameworkCore.Design
Please run these commands in your terminal within the project directory to ensure that you have all the necessary tools for database operations.
